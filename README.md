Or browse posts by topic:

![Topics](./public/assets/images/README%20screenshots/Categories.png)

To do more than browse existing posts, register for an account from the login menu:

After registering/logging in, you are able to access a dashboard:

From the dashboard, you can access the posts that you have authored, as well as posts that you have favorited. When you click on hyperlinked usernames, you can get a similar view of any other user, without the edit/delete functionality:
